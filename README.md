This project is a React application built with Next.js that demonstrates the usage of various React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It also incorporates a fake API using JSON Server and includes the creation of charts with React ApexCharts based on the fetched data.

   - npm install

Add and start JSON Server:
   - npm install -g json-server
   - json-server --watch db.json --port 4000
